title: Pynorama Version 0.2.4
---
<p>A new version of Pynorama <small>technically</small> got released.
In this new version there are Makefiles! That means you can now
<strong>install</strong> this thing. That also means, intalling this thing
may not work. Regardless, the new version is avaiable on GitHub under the
<a href="http://github.com/odraencoded/pynorama/tree/v0.2.4">v0.2.4 tag</a>.

<p>Besides makefiles a ton of preferences have been added. Let's be honest,
this program has way too many settings for an image viewer. I've been thinking
of changing the slogan to <q>an image viewer and control panel</q>.

	<ul class="change-list">
	<li><h6 class="summary">View alignment has replaced scrollbar position</h6>
		<p>The <q>default scrollbar position</q> feature was intended to 
		automatically move the scrollbars to a position after changing images.
		<br>That didn't work well with the image strip layout because the way
		scrollbar positions are calculated when images fit inside the view is
		different of when they don't fit inside the view.
		<p>This new settings does the aligning properly plus it can be used as
		default alignment, pivot point or anchor point in a number of other
		features that have access to the image view widget.
		
	<li><h6 class="summary">Mouse settings have been added</h6>
		<p>A <q>Mouse</q> tab has been added to the preferences dialog. In that
		tab you can add or remove mouse mechanisms which control what the mouse
		does in relation to the view.
		<br>There are currently seven mouse mechanisms to choose from,
		they are:
		<ul>
			<li>Drag to Pan
			<li>Move Mouse to Pan
			<li>Drag to Spin
			<li>Drag to Stretch
			<li>Scroll to Pan
			<li>Scroll to Zoom
			<li>Scroll to Spin
		</ul>
		<p>Each mechanism can be added multiple times, each instance has it's
		own settings and they can be given nicknames to help identify which
		is which. If the mechanism needs a button, such as the ones for
		dragging, the button can be choosen with a mouse click.
