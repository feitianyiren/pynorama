<p>A <a href="https://github.com/odraencoded/pynorama/releases/tag/v0.2.5">new version of Pynorama</a>
<small>apparently</small> got released.

<p>This new version has mostly internal changes.
Nothing of exceptional was added.
<section id="v0-2-5-changelog" class="change-log">
	<h3 class="change-version">Version 0.2.5 Changelog</h3>
	
	<ul class="change-list">
	<li><h6 class="summary">Mouse functions can be bound to <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd> and <kbd>Shift</kbd> keys</kbd></h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>With this, different things can be achievement with the same mouse
			button or wheel. For example, pynorama can be configured so that
			the scroll wheel can be used for scrolling the contents of an image,
			but when the <kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key</kbd> is pressed it will zoom
			to the mouse pointer instead.
		</div>
	<li><h6 class="summary">Images can now be copied</h6>
	<li><h6 class="summary">Text can be pasted into the image viewer</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>Raw text, copied from text boxes and other applications,
			can now be pasted into the image viewer.
			The text will be interpreted as if it was a valid URI. If it's not a
			valid URI, nothing will happen.
		</div>
	<li><h6 class="summary">Improved memory performance for opaque images</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>Opaque images were wrongly stored with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing">alpha channel</a>
			which they didn't need. That has been fixed so, if my math is right,
			opaque images now use 1/4 less memory.
		</div>
	<li><h6 class="summary">Tooltips have been added to the statusbar</h6>
	<li><h6 class="summary">Minor bugs have been fixed</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<ul>
				<li><p>The <q>Loading</q> text that was supposed to replace the
				image dimensions in the statusbar when an image is loading now
				actually replaces the image dimensions in the statusbar
				when an image is loading.
				<li><p>A few focus detection and image positioning bugs have
				been fixed on the image strip layout. And it still doesn't work.
				But at least it no longer locks panning images if an huge image
				is beside to a very small one.
