	<ul class="change-list">
	<li>
		<h6 class="summary">
			Extensible preferences tabs
		</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>The tabs in the preferences dialog have been made extensible.
			That means an addon script can now add its own preferences tab to
			the dialog, which is kind of nice. Too bad there are no addons
			for the image viewer.
		</div>
	<li>
		<h6 class="summary">
			Customizable background
		</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>The background colour of the image viewer can now be customized.
			Users can set either a flat color can be set or choose two colors
			for a checkered pattern.
		</div>
	<li>
		<h6 class="summary">
			Magnifying glass
		</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>A <i>magnifying glass</i> has been added to the image viewer. It can
			be used to have different level of magnification in a small part
			of the window.
			<p>Three mouse mechanisms have been added to allow it to be
			controlled with the mouse. There is no way to control the
			magnifying glass with the keyboard so far but that will change one
			day, maybe.
		</div>
	<li>
		<h6 class="summary">
			Bug-fixed: Auto-zoom mis-re-applied
		</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>A bug has been fixed that caused <i>auto-zoom</i> feature to not
			work well with the <i>image strip layout</i> or other possible
			layouts that allowed the user to change the focused image through
			panning.
			
			<p>Previously, resizing the window after panning through the images
			after setting the auto-zoom on a image would reapply the auto-zoom
			for this new image. Now, the auto-zoom calculates a zoom level
			using the size of the image that was the focus image when it was
			turned on.
			
			<p>It's hard to explain, either way it's been fixed!
		</div>
	<li>
		<h6 class="summary">
			A memory leak has been fixed
		</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>Honestly, I can't remember whether the memory leak existed in
			the previous version or I created it after that but I'm reporting
			it either way so it appears I'm actually being busy.
		</div>
	<li>
		<h6 class="summary">
			Massive refactoring
		</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>Most of the program code has been divided into new files. This
			might help organizing it, or not. I'm not sure whether it will
			affect the capabilities of the program itself.
			<p>Being busy.
