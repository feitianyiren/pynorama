---
<p>According to this website, a
<a href="https://github.com/odraencoded/pynorama/releases/tag/v0.2.6"
title="Namely the 0.2.6 version">new version of Pynorama</a> has been released.

<p>This new version focused primarily on opening images.
Not much has been done, it was mostly refactoring. A bunch of bugs have been
fixed and the text printed to the console is now coloured. I think that is
pretty neat.

<article id="v0-2-6-changelog" class="change-log">
	<h3 class="change-version">Version 0.2.6 Changelog</h2>
	
	<ul class="change-list">
	<li>
		<h6 class="summary">
			Bug fixed: Certain preferences were not being saved
		</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>In the last version release, somehow, the auto zoom mode 
			preference was not added to the preference saving list. It's now
			been added and is saved normally, I hope.
			<p>When exiting the aplication after changing the layout
			preferences using menu items, those preferences weren't saved.
			That has been fixed too.
		</div>
	<li>
		<h6 class="summary">
			Bug fixed: Filenames pasted that start with an user code are
			now correctly identified as filenames.
		</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>Before, if you pasted a filename such as
			<code>~/Pictures/cake.jpg</code> it wouldn't be opened because it
			isn't an absolute path. Now the tilde is automatically expanded,
			and the file is correctly opened.
		</div>
	<li>
		<h6 class="summary">
			When opening a directory without images, subdirectories are
			automatically opened too.
		</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>If you try to open a directory that doesn't have any images but
			has subdirectories, those subdirectories will be being opened.
			If those directories don't have images but have subdirectories,
			the same thing happens, recursively, until it stops happening.
		</div>
	<li>
		<h6 class="summary">
			Clicking on the <q>Add</q> button in the <q>open image</q> dialog
			doesn't close the dialog anymore.
		</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>If you click the <q>Add</q> button an image or directory will be
			added to the image viewer but the dialog will be kept open so
			you can add more images and/or directories.
			<p>Clicking on the <q>Open</q> button after clicking in the
			<q>Add</q> button will not remove all images from the image viewer,
			but it will close the dialog.
			<p>Incidentally clicking on the <s><q>Cancel</q></s> <q>Close</q>
			button always closes the dialog.
		</div>
	<li>
		<h6 class="summary">
			The entire image opening API has been redesigned.
		</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>This means nothing to the end user, but to developers it means
			there is a new <em>flawed</em> way to tell the program to do
			its thing.
		</div>
	<li>
		<h6 class="summary">
			The text printed to the console is now coloured.
		</h6>
		<div class="details">
			<p>I think that is pretty neat!
