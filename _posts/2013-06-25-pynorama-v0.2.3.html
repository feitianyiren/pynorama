title: Pynorama Version 0.2.3
---
<p>A new version of Pynorama <small>sort of</small> got released.
Preferences were added to the program that required a lot of code and
that pratically nobody is going to use. Check the
<a href="http://github.com/odraencoded/pynorama/tree/v0.2.3">v0.2.3 tag</a>
on GitHub to get this version.


<p>Of course, I'm talking about the preferences of the incredibly super amazing
layout stuff that nobody is going to extend any further than this.

<section id="v0-2-3-changelog" class="change-log">
	<h3 class="change-version">Version 0.2.3 Changelog</h3>
	
	<ul class="change-list">
	<li><h6 class="summary">A View &rarr; Layout menu was added</h6>
		<p>Users can now select between the two currently avaiable album
		layouts, <q>Single Image</q> and <q>Image Strip</q>, plus any
		future layout added to the program. <strong>If</strong> anybody
		programs a new one, that is.
		
	<li><h6 class="summary">The image strip layout can now be configured</h6>
		<p>There is now a settings dialog and <em>a bunch of menu items</em>
		for configuring how the image strip layout places its images.
			
		<p>The single image layout didn't get a settings dialog, or a bunch of
		menu items, because it's too bland and has no settings to configure
		at all.
			
	<li><h6 class="summary"> Menu tooltips are now shown in the statusbar</h6>
		
		<p>Finally, the statusbar does something more useful than just
		displaying the loading status, and occasional loading errors.
		It now shows a tooltip menu items being hovered by the mouse.
		
		<p>It <em>also</em> shows the tooltips if you select a menu item
		through the keyboard, which I assume nobody does.
		
	</ul>
